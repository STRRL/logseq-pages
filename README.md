# logseq-pages

A cli tool for list all pages in logseq repo, marked with public or private.

When I using [logseq](https://github.com/logseq/logseq) to build my knowledge base and publish publicly, I found that "Make it public for publishing" and "Make it private" could only be accessed on the application. So I have to manually walk though all the pages and make sure that all I wanted to be published pages have been marked as public.

That is terrible experience.

So I would write the cli tools to:

- list all the pages
- mark pages as public or private
